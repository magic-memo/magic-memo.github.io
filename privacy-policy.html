        <p>MagicMemo does not collect, store, or share any personal information unless explicitly required for specific features of the app.</p>
        <p>However, in order to sync your data across devices and offer certain features, such as text-to-speech functionality, we may upload certain data to Apple's **CloudKit** or send user input to **Microsoft's TTS (Text-to-Speech) service**.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>MagicMemo uses third-party services to enhance your experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CloudKit:</strong> MagicMemo uses Apple's **CloudKit** service to sync your data across devices. This ensures that all your memorization data, including OCR results and learning progress, are seamlessly accessible across your devices. The data stored in CloudKit is encrypted and protected by Apple’s privacy policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Microsoft TTS Service:</strong> When you use the text-to-speech functionality, user-entered text may be transmitted to Microsoft's TTS service for processing. This service uses advanced AI technology to generate speech from text. The data may be stored temporarily by Microsoft in order to process the request and generate audio. Please note that Microsoft’s privacy policy applies to this service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect or store any personal information without your explicit consent, and we strive to keep all data secure and private.</p>
